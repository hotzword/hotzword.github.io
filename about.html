              <p>Cooking is part of my graduate life. Over the years, my cooking style is taking a gradient descent towards more convenient dishes. Now it is somewhat converging to some local minima in terms of time and energy spent. Pan-seared steak can be prepared during my breakfast within 15 min, and some soups just involve throwing everything into the pot. But sometimes my objective function weights more heavily on satisfaction of my Chinese stomach. I would go out of my way to seek for some specific flavors. My friends and me myself often times get surprised how well the dishes turn out to be. The excitement and satisfaction on their face encouraged me to record and share my secrets of cooking. </p>
    
              <p>So here we are, the "Hello World" of my food blog. Here you can find recipes of some simple and convenient dishes, as well as some tasty but more complicated ones - believe me, it's worth it. I also try to include general tips and experience that I summarized over time. Hopefully it will be useful not only for the specific dishes, but also for generally cooking tasty and healthy food. Make your discovery and guten appetit! </p>
