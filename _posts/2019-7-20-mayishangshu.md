tips: 
    - <p> Sweet potato vermicelli noodle is recommended for this dish. Submerge it in hot or boiled water so that it is mostly cooked before stir fried. In this way we do not have to add too much water to the wok to soften the vermicelli noodle, which in turn allows higher wok temperature to bring out the flavors. 
    - Seasoning the meat beforehand can add more flavor, but is optional. 
    - Sichuan peppercorn flavored oil can balance the flavor of meat and add another layer of flavor. Alternatively, you can add Sichuan peppercorn together with oil in step 3, keep on medium low heat until the flavor is brought out, then discard the peppercorn. (You would not want to accidentally chew on the numbing Sichuan peppercorn).

<p>Ants climbing a tree is a traditional Sichuan dish. It is a vivid way of describing how the minced meat is scattered over the vermicelli noodles which looks like tree branches, with green scallions serving as leaves. A savory dish I loved since childhood, and glad that I can bring back the taste with this recipe. </p>
