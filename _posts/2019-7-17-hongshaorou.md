tips: 
    - The best kind of beef for braising is those with fat and lean meat interwoven, which will lead to a tender texture. 
    - Pixian County Bean Paste is a kind of bean paste made with faba bean, salt and chilly. It is available in most Asian groceries. Bean paste is the soul of many Sichuan dishes, from stir fry, braising to steaming. It provides a special salty and slightly spicy taste.
    - The amount of seasoning sauces are flexible, all depending on your preference. Some people would just taste the broth as they add the sauces, until they feel the right salty level. The common soy sauce is to add salty taste, and the dark soy sauce is to add dark color. 
    - For different ingredients, different time is needed to be cooked. Thus we stew meat first, then add the veggies later.

<p>Braised beef is another extremely popular dish on every Chinese family's dining table. For the different preference of every households, it has the flexibility to be adjusted sweeter or spicier. Now when I don't feel like exploring I would just do some braising as workday's bento box. It has a balanced nutrition of meat, veggie and carbon, not too much oil so pretty healthy. I always take the waiting time for braising to wash the dishes, clean up the kitchen space and do other chore that I normally hate. Then, after a long while, the meat turns tender and richly seasoned -- the waiting time is just worth it. </p>
