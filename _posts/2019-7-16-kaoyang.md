tips: 
    - At the stewing step, make sure that the water is salty enough, so that the meat can be fully seasoned. If you really do not like the strong odor of lamb, you can add cooking wine, ginger slices, or other things while stewing.  
    - Wrapping up while roasting is to make sure the meat would not go dry. Chili powder is easy to get burned so we add that after meat is broiled. 
    - You can pair the lamb with anything you like. For example Brussels sprout and potatoes can be baked alongside the lamb.

<p> This is a traditional way of roast lamb in Northern China.  It ensures that the strong oder is totally removed, and that the meat is tender inside, crispy outside.  </p>
