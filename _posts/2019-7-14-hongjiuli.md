tips: 
    - Well, this is a really easy and quick-hand dessert, and do not require lot of actual cooking time. We used the cheapest supermarket red wine, which would be too acid to the taste but just right for poached pears. The only improvement should be that we should separate the rosemary when cooking, since it is so hard to remove and influenced the outlook lol.

This is a French dish, which seems to be a dessert as well as an art. Possibly one of the best destinies for left-over wine and not-ripe-yet pear -- when they combined together you will have nothing to complain. The light sheds on the juicy ruby pear, like the sunset set a lake on fire. You can almost feel the autumn breeze carrying the smell of ripe harvest. A bite and it's the same coolness as lemon soda water. The strong alcohol is half boiled away, substituted by a mild but more complex tone of sugar sweet and orange refreshment and cinnamon fragrance, with a touch of acid bitterness from the wine, all seamlessly mixed together. I just can't remember how I finish the last bite without notice.
