    - txt: Use high heat all the time. Add in 2 teaspoons of <b>oil</b> in a hot wok. Pour in the <b>egg mixture</b>. Wait till the egg liquid starts to go solid. Stir the eggs into small pieces. Cook until there is no runny eggs, then pour it back into the bowl. The egg's color should be yellow, since turning brown means it is overcooked.

tips: 
    - The soul of stir-fry is heat and oil. Only enough heat can best stimulate the flavor of the ingredients, which generally true for Sichuan dishes. The ingredients added in will bring the temperature down, and that is why I emphasized on keeping the wok well heated before adding things in, and use high heat all the time. When you can feel warmth when you put you hand over it, the pan is readily heat.
    - Normally, adding in more oil can make the dish taste better, especially when stir-frying eggs -- another fact generally hold for Sichuan dishes. But too much oil is unhealthy and I just can't do it to myself. My mom told me to add oil not at the beginning, but when the wok is heated and starts to give off thin smoke, calling it "hot wok cold oil". I don't know why, perhaps it's good for the oil.
    - The scallion is only to make the flavor rich, and also add in a pinch of green to give a better look. I often skip that when I feel lazy, it doesn't hurt the key flavor.
    - Alright, although I have put down so much words, I hope you find the dish easy enough. If you have succeeded tomato and egg stir-fry, congratulations, you have got the entry ticket to the whole amazing world of stir-fires!

Tomato and egg stir-fry is possibly one of the first dishes one would learn to cook back in my hometown. It's simple, it's fast, and yet the flavor of fresh sweet-sour tomato mixed with soft egg is so incredible. When I'm feeling lazy at lunch time I'll just pick eggs and tomatoes out of the fridge, do the stir fry, and pour it onto rice or soup noodle -- lunch within 20 minutes!
