tips: 
    - Remember, the gravy must be stronger flavored than you would normally take, so that the meat can gain the proper level of saltiness. You can add spice and Sichuan pepper if you love hot spice. 
    - When you can stick in the meat with a fork or chopstick without difficulty, the meat is ready. Do not excessively stew the meat or they will get too loose. 
    - You can add some cooked egg when stewing meat. Remember to crack the egg shell to let it better marinate.

<p>Chef Kun makes the best Chinese marinated beef. Every time he brings this dish to his workplace for share, it will be finished within a minute. I do feel the urge to let more people appreciate the magic of Chinese marinated dishes. So here we are, today I have the honor to share his secret of how to make Chinese braised beef as good as any restaurant you can find.</p>

<p>Actually it took me a long time to find the proper English name for this dish. It's like braised beef, but normally it is served cold and without gravy. It is sometimes called spiced beef because it is so richly flavored. Marinated beef can best emphasize the special flavor gained by marinating the beef in spiced gravy for a long time. Also, you can put in so many different stuffs along side beef. Beef shank, beef tendon, pork tongue, eggs, chicken feet, to name just a few, all goes perfect. In the picture above, it's actually a mixture of beef and pork tongue slices. </p>
