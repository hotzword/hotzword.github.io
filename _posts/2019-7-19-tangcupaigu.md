tips: 
    - I always get those pork ribs at grocery fresh counters (like whole foods) and ask butcher to chop the ribs into small pieces. Costco has readily chopped pork ribs as well.  
    - Boiling the meat and washing the meat is the fastest way remove the blood inside the meat, so as to remove the strong odor. Cooking wine and ginger is also for oder removing. Another typical way is to emerge the meat in cold water together with cooking wine for half an hour, and wash the meat thoroughly.- The longer you simmer the pork rib, the softer and seasoned it will become (meaning tastier!) The minimum time is 30 min or when you use a fork you can easily thrust through the meat.
    - The ratio of the sources is the key. They will provide just the right balance of sweet and sour taste. Light soy source is to provide salty taste so there is no need to add additional salt. </p>

<p>Sweet and sour pork rib is one of the most popular dishes all around China. A hundred people might have a hundred ways to cook it. Some approaches might be challenging for beginners -- like melting sugar in the oil with just right heat so the sugar goes brown but does not burn, then heat a large amount of oil and deep fry pork rib so that the rib goes crispy outside and tender inside. The above mentioned is the most authentic way which you can possibly try in restaurants. But doing so requires an extremely good sense for the timing, as well as a really powerful stove. Here I will introduce an simplified and foolproof version, which compromises for the perfect brown shiny "sugar color", but maintains the essence of sweet and sour flavor. What's more, substituting deep fry with slow brew makes it healthier for everyday meal.  </p>
