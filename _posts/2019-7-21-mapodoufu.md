tips: 
    -  Be sure to add just enough water to cover tofu. You will not want to much water or the dish will become thin tofu soup, or you will spend a lot of time boiling the water away. 
    - Corn starch is the key to make the broth thick. Dissolve it beforehand so it can fully mix with water instead of forming lumps. 
    - Pixian County Bean Paste should give enough flavor, if not, you can add soy sauce or salt to taste.Seasoning the meat beforehand can add more flavor, but is optional.
    - Sichuan peppercorn flavored oil or powder can balance the flavor of meat and add another layer of flavor. Remember to add Sichuan peppercorn powder in the very end, because excessive heat will burn it black. Alternatively, you can add Sichuan peppercorn together with oil in step 3, keep on medium low heat until the flavor is brought out, then discard the peppercorn.
